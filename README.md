## Calculation Equations & Derived Metrics

### Financial Health Score (0-100 points)

#### Program Expense Ratio
```
Program Expense Ratio = Program Expenses / Total Expenses
Target: â‰¥75% (40 points maximum)

Score = min(40, (Program Expense Ratio / 0.75) * 40)
```

#### Administrative Expense Ratio
```
Admin Expense Ratio = Administrative Expenses / Total Expenses
Target: â‰¤15% (20 points maximum)

Score = max(0, 20 - ((Admin Expense Ratio - 0.15) * 133.33))
```

#### Fundraising Expense Ratio
```
Fundraising Expense Ratio = Fundraising Expenses / Total Expenses
Target: â‰¤15% (20 points maximum)

Score = max(0, 20 - ((Fundraising Expense Ratio - 0.15) * 133.33))
```

#### Financial Stability
```
Net Assets = Total Assets - Total Liabilities
Stability Score = 20 points if Net Assets > 0, else 0 points
```

### Trend Analysis Modifier (Â±20 points)

#### Revenue Growth Rate
```
Annual Growth Rate = (Current Year Revenue - Previous Year Revenue) / Previous Year Revenue
5-Year Average Growth = Average of annual growth rates over 5 years

Growth Modifier = Â±10 points based on consistency:
- Stable positive growth (2-8% annually): +10 points
- Volatile but positive: +5 points
- Declining revenue: -10 points
```

#### Volatility Penalty
```
Revenue Volatility = Standard Deviation of annual revenue changes
Volatility Penalty = min(10, (Volatility / 0.3) * 10)

Final Trend Modifier = Growth Modifier - Volatility Penalty
Range: -20 to +10 points
```

### External Validation Bonus (0-45 points)

#### Charity Navigator Integration
```
Star Rating Bonus = Charity Navigator Stars Ã— 5 points (max 20 points)
No Advisory Alerts = +5 points
```

#### Transparency & Compliance
```
Transparency Seal = +10 points
IRS Pub 78 Listed = +5 points
Recent Form 990 Filing = +5 points
```

#### Negative News Penalty
```
Negative News Alerts = -10 points per significant alert
```

### Compliance Penalties

#### IRS Status Violations
```
Not in IRS Pub 78 = -50 points
Auto-revoked status = -100 points (immediate F grade)
No recent filing (>3 years) = -25 points
```

### Final Grade Assignment

#### Total Score Calculation
```
Total Score = Financial Health Score + Trend Modifier + Validation Bonus + Compliance Penalties
```

#### Grade Thresholds
```
A: â‰¥90 points - Excellent charity
B: 75-89 points - Good charity
C: 60-74 points - Acceptable charity
D: 45-59 points - Poor charity
F: <45 points - Failing charity
```
